TODO:
  * Setup README.md.
  * Should --no-create not call git init? (update man page if changed).
  * Document config file.
  * Make example config to be installed to be installed to /etc (update man page).
  * Set up some kind of intelligent version/module name interpolation using autotools/sed?

DONE:
  * All output should have $0 prepended to make it clear where it comes from.
    (Ex. ./git_sync.sh: Error).
  * Create a "fail" function that prints something and exits with some code.
  * Create an unmount function to reduce code duplication.
  * Add no-create option.
  * Make an actual git repo and put this there.
  * Come up with a better name. (gdrive-sync?)
  * Create a makefile/install setup (using autoconf/automake?)
  * Double quote varialbe references (ouch)
  * Make an explicit verbose mode that gives all ouput. Non verbose mode should run rsync
    quiet, gcamlfuse quiet, and not show would-be green messages.
  * Make print usage actually do something useful.
  * Check home director for config file by default.
  * Be sure to check return from ALL git commands (and all commands) to be
    sure they're executed properly.
  * Figure out how to handle the default README.md (just keep it simple)
  * Build man page as part of make process.
  * Setup man page and add to autoconf build.
  * Move todo stuff to a real todo.

ABANDONED:
  * Add functionality for sending mail regarding latest git commit.
    Use output from 'git show --stat'.
    [Actally, cron does this for us, so probably no need].
